JavaScript and DOM Manipulation


In this challenge we used D3 to manipulate dinamicaly the data and the webpage.

I uploaded the starter index (indexStarter.html) file in case you want to see the results with that format and the index.html with a simpler format

1. In the first level we just wanted to filter the data from a given date
2. In the second level we added more filters that works together to filter further

Hope tyhat you have fun with the UFOs Sightings... the thruth is out there!
